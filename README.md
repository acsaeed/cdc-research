# CDC Research by Ali Saeed
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code I authored for my research internship at Amaral Lab, part of Northwestern Institute of Complex Systems. I designed tests in Python to assess the quality of the Codon Deviation Coefficient, a metric introduced to quantiy a phenomenon known as codon usage bias (CUB). Information about codon usage bias can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon_usage_bias
The paper that introduces the Codon Deviation Coefficient (CDC) can be read here: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-43
The doctoral student with whom I worked provided me with the criteria that a robust CUB metric would meet and asked me to design tests to determine which of these criteria the CDC meets. In order to do so, I generated hypothetical genetic sequences from probability distributions and analyzed the ability of the CDC to accurately quantify their relative levels of bias. At the end of my internship, I presented my findings to the Amaral Lab group.
If you are interested in running my code for yourself or learning more, feel free to send me an email, and I will provide you with the FASTA files for the E. coli genome which I used to run some tests.
